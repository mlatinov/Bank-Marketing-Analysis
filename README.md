📞 Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis with R & Tidymodels


🔍 Project Overview

Banks use direct marketing campaigns to promote financial products, but predicting customer responses can significantly improve efficiency. This project focuses on analyzing a Portuguese banking 

institution’s telemarketing campaign to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit.

We will leverage R and the Tidymodels framework to build, evaluate, and optimize multiple classification models using AUC (Area Under the Curve) as the primary metric.


📊 Key Insights

✅ Understanding customer engagement patterns in telemarketing campaigns.

✅ Identifying the most influential factors that drive term deposit subscriptions.

✅ Optimizing predictive models to enhance marketing efficiency.


🎯 Objectives

🔹 Explore and preprocess the dataset to ensure data quality.

🔹 Build and compare different machine learning models using Tidymodels in R.

🔹 Identify key factors influencing customer decisions.

🔹 Evaluate model performance using AUC and other relevant metrics.


📌 Dataset & Methodology

Dataset: Bank Marketing Dataset (donated on 02/13/2012).

Instances: 45,211 (main dataset), 41,188 (additional dataset with 20 features).

Features: 16 key variables, including categorical and integer types.

Timeframe: May 2008 – November 2010.

Task: Binary classification (yes or no subscription).


⚙️ Machine Learning Framework

Framework: Tidymodels.

Models Used: To be determined (to be updated as experiments progress).


🚀 Why This Matters

Optimizing bank marketing campaigns through machine learning can reduce costs, improve customer targeting, and increase subscription rates, leading to more efficient financial decision-making.
